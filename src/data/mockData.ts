    body: '<p>In the age of soft warfare, empire needs brokers, not boots on the ground. The battlefield is no longer limited to terrain; it has expanded to narrative, and the most potent weapons in this war are not drones or diplomats but proxies – and among the most potent are diaspora communities. These are not incidental populations; they are carriers of memory, capital, linguistic dexterity, and transnational networks. They hold sway in media, policymaking, academia, and cultural production. And imperialism knows it. These populations are not just spoken of or to but spoken through. Institutions increasingly platform English-speaking, upper-class diaspora voices, think tanks, and governments in the Global North, not because they represent the will of the people back home… but rather because they do not. The dislocation becomes an advantage: the farther one is from the realities of hunger and imperialism, the easier it is to convert anger into policy proposals that imperialism will accept.</p>\n<p>These voices are carefully selected, often from the upper rungs of society: those who could afford exit, education, and entry into the halls of Western legitimacy. They are fluent, credentialed, well-mannered, and well-dressed in the language of empire, and it is that fluency that becomes legibility. It makes their politics not just heard, but platformed – in op-eds, conferences, sanctions hearings, “civil society” briefings… and the news (Piers Morgan Uncensored, in particular, has done irreversible damage, I believe),</p>\n<p>Recall the age-old warning: “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” – Audre Lorde</p>',

    body: '<p><em>Conducted by Qasim Ansari for VoxUmmah</em></p>\n<p>In the wake of Israel’s war on Gaza – and the subsequent escalation across the region – Iran once again finds itself framed as both instigator and threat. The narratives are familiar: the Islamic Republic as an oppressive regime that must be dismantled and resistance as proxy warfare. But beneath these headlines lie deeper questions: about sovereignty, theology, memory, and power. What does it mean for a nation to remain defiant in a world that demands submission? What price does resistance carry when shaped by faith?</p>\n<p>To explore these questions, VoxUmmah sat down with Zainab Zakariyah, a Nigerian journalist, analyst, and activist based in Tehran. Born into the scholarly Zakariyah family, Zainab grew up between bookshelves and battlegrounds – raised on centuries-old Islamic scholarship in Sokoto and scarred by the modern brutality of externally backed violence in her homeland.</p>',

    body: '<p>Time does not walk forward; it swings. Not evenly, not gently, but with the burden of consequence – back and forth between oppression and revolt, wealth and ruin, power and its collapse. It is not progress that drives history but pressure, rupture, and recoil. History, when told by the empire, is made to look like ascent. But when you examine the bones beneath – the enslaved, the looted, the scorched, you begin to see the rhythm for what it is: not a line but a pendulum.</p>\n<p>More than poetic, this metaphor is analytical. It reveals that what we call the “present” is often a rebranded past, that what is framed as stability is usually the calm between two swings. Domination re-emerges in new forms; resistance inherits old lessons. The pendulum may shift its costume, but not its choreography. Anti-imperialist thinkers – across continents and centuries have argued that empire never truly leaves, it evolves; from the lash to the loan, from missionary zeal to development aid, from maps to markets.</p>\n<p>To think geopolitics through this metaphor is to disarm the lie of linearity. It is to understand that what the West sells as progress is often only repetition – a cycle in which the coloniser returns, wearing democracy’s smile and carrying data rather than whips.</p>',

This bombshell report details the multi-year cover-up and its devastating global impact.\n\nThe investigation began when whistleblowers came forward with internal documents showing a pattern of regulatory capture that spans multiple industries. These documents reveal how corporate lobbyists have systematically undermined oversight mechanisms, creating an environment where public safety takes a backseat to private profit.\n\nKey findings include evidence of revolving door relationships between regulators and industry executives, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and the deliberate suppression of safety studies that could have prevented numerous public health crises.\n\nThe implications of these findings extend far beyond any single company or industry. They point to a fundamental breakdown in the systems designed to protect the public interest, raising serious questions about the effectiveness of current regulatory frameworks in an era of increasing corporate consolidation.',

    body: 'The structural contradictions inherent in neoliberal capitalism have reached a critical inflection point. As capital accumulation confronts systemic limits, the ideological apparatus that sustained the order disintegrates. This analysis examines the material conditions precipitating the collapse of post-Cold War hegemony and the emerging counter-hegemonic forces reshaping global political economy.\n\nFrom sub-prime mortgage crises to the erosion of wage standards across the Global North, the empirical evidence of neoliberalism\'s failure accumulates daily. Yet rather than confronting the systemic nature of these contradictions, liberal reformists propose palliatives that leave the fundamental structures of capitalist exploitation intact.\n\nThe dialectical movement toward a post-capitalist order accelerates as the working classes of the periphery increasingly assert their agency. The question is no longer whether neoliberalism will fall, but what force will shape its successor.',

The narratives are familiar: the Islamic Republic as an oppressive regime that must be dismantled and resistance as proxy warfare. But beneath these headlines lie deeper questions: about sovereignty, theology, memory, and power. What does it mean for a nation to remain defiant in a world that demands submission? What price does resistance carry when shaped by faith?</p>\n<p>To explore these questions, VoxUmmah sat down with Zainab Zakariyah, a Nigerian journalist, analyst, and activist based in Tehran. Born into the scholarly Zakariyah family, Zainab grew up between bookshelves and battlegrounds – raised on centuries-old Islamic scholarship in Sokoto and scarred by the modern brutality of externally backed violence in her homeland.</p>',

Here, in the rhythms of collective labor, in the shared experience of exploitation, revolutionary potential germinates. Yet the traditional left has abandoned these spaces, ceding control to techno-bureaucratic management and algorithmic control systems.\n\nA return to factory organizing is not nostalgic reactionism but strategic necessity.

It reveals that what we call the “present” is often a rebranded past, that what is framed as stability is usually the calm between two swings. Domination re-emerges in new forms; resistance inherits old lessons. The pendulum may shift its costume, but not its choreography. Anti-imperialist thinkers – across continents and centuries have argued that empire never truly leaves, it evolves; from the lash to the loan, from missionary zeal to development aid, from maps to markets.</p>\n<p>To think geopolitics through this metaphor is to disarm the lie of linearity.

His concept of cultural hegemony—the domination of the subordinate classes through consent rather than coercion alone—illuminates how capitalist ideologies naturalize themselves through civil society institutions.\n\nIn the digital age, the terrain of hegemonic struggle has shifted. Corporate control over information networks, algorithmic manipulation of consciousness, and the colonization of intimate life by commodity logic represent new mechanisms of subordination that Gramsci could not have anticipated. Yet his theoretical framework remains vital.\n\nGramsci\'s emphasis on the counterhegemonic potential of organic intellectuals rooted in subordinated classes provides a pathway beyond both mechanical materialism and idealist voluntarism. To challenge capitalist hegemony in our epoch requires understanding how domination operates through culture, media, and technology while simultaneously building alternative institutions of collective self-determination.',

Yet Marxist analysis reveals that class exploitation is not an accidental feature of capitalism but its structural necessity. Capital requires the extraction of surplus labor. No tax policy fundamentally alters this.\n\nMoreover, Piketty\'s historical analysis contains blind spots regarding imperialism\'s role in capital accumulation. The wealth concentrated in the center of the capitalist system rests on systematic plundering of the periphery—a dynamic invisible in Piketty\'s framework.\n\nNevertheless, Piketty\'s work offers valuable documentary evidence of capitalism\'s crisis tendencies and the impossibility of egalitarian distribution within its logic.
